== Concepts

=== A static meta model is optional

First let's stress this: a static meta model is optional for the Cypher-DSL. It is completely OK to use the Cypher-DSL
as shown in the <<how-to-use-it.examples,examples in the "How to use it" part>>:
all labels, types and properties can be named as you go.
The Cypher-DSL will still give you type-safety in regard to the Cypher's syntax.

This fits nicely with Neo4j's capabilities: Neo4j is a schemaless database. Nodes, their relationships between each other,
their labels and properties can be changed as you go but all of this information can still be queried.

In a schemaless database or a database with dynamic scheme the scheme is often defined by the application.
This definition takes many forms: It can be through an object mapper like https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm[Neo4j-OGM] or
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#reference[Spring Data Neo4j 6+], or maybe in form of
Graph-QL schemes.

Another source may be the information we can retrieve from the database itself via https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/#procedure_db_schema_nodetypeproperties[`db.schema.nodeTypeProperties`] and
https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/#procedure_db_schema_reltypeproperties[`db.schema.relTypeProperties`].

[[static-meta-model.building-blocks]]
=== Building blocks

The Cypher DSL offers the following building blocks as part of the public API:

* Two pattern elements:
** Nodes via `Node` (and its default implementation `NodeBase`)
** Relationships via `Relationship` (and its default implementation `RelationshipBase`)
* `Property`, which is a holder for properties

When you use Cypher-DSL like this:

[source,java]
----
var m = Cypher.node("Movie").named("m");
var statement = Cypher.match(m).returning(this.m).build();
----

`m` will be a `Node` instance having the label `Movie` and an alias of `m`. `m` can be used everywhere where a pattern element
can be used according to the openCypher spec.
You don't have to care about its type. That's why we vouched for the JDK11+ local type inference here and omitted the
declaration of the type `Node`: it just reads better.

=== A very simple, static model

Both `NodeBase` and  `RelationshipBase` are meant to be extended to put your static model into something that is usable
with the Cypher-DSL.

==== Nodes

Start by extending `NodeBase` like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/Movie.java[tag=simple-model]
----
<.> Extend from `NodeBase` and specify your class as a "self" type-argument
<.> Optional: Create one static instance of your model
<.> This is where you specify one or more label
<.> This constructor is optional, it is used in the next two steps
<.> `named` must be overridden and must return new copies of the node, with the changed symbolic name.
    It must be overridden to guarantee type integrity.
<.> Same as above

With that in place, you can already use it like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
[[static-movie]]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=simple-model]
----

and it would generate a Cypher string like this: `"MATCH (jwKyXzwS000:`Movie`) RETURN jwKyXzwS000"`, with generated variable names.

If you don't like them, you can just rename one instance of the movie-model like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=simple-model-renamed]
----

Of course, properties belong into a model as well. You add them like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/Movie.java[tag=add-properties]
----
<.> Same class before, extending from `NodeBase`.
<.> Use `this` and the `property` method to create a new `Property` instance, stored on the given instance

A possible usage scenario looks like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/StaticModelIT.java[tag=add-properties]
----
<.> Make sure to use the renamed instance everywhere. Here: For accessing the property. Alternatively, don't rename.

==== Relationships

Relationships are a bit more complicated. Relationships of the same type can be used between nodes with different labels.
We have these scenarios:

* `(s:LabelA) - (r:SomeType) -> (e:LabelB)`:
* `(s:LabelA) - (r:SomeType) -> (e)`
* `(s) - (r:SomeType) -> (e)`

We either have a type that is used only between the same set of labels, or a type is used always with one fixed label or
a type is used between arbitrary labels.

To accommodate for that, the default relationship implementation, `RelationshipBase`, spots three type parameters:

[source,java]
----
public class RelationshipBase<S extends NodeBase<?>, E extends NodeBase<?>, SELF extends RelationshipBase<S, E, SELF>> {
}
----

`S` is the type of a start node, `E` of an end node and `SELF` is the concrete implementation itself.
The public API of `RelationshipBase` enforces a direction from start to end (`LTR`, left to right).

We just have a look at the first case to make the concepts clear. We model the `ACTED_IN` relationship of the movie graph.
It exists between people and movies (going from person to movie) and has an attribute roles:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/ActedIn.java[tag=simple-model]
----
<.> The base class, with 3 concrete types. A `Person`, the `Movie` from <<static-movie>> and the type itself.
<.> Same idea with as with nodes: Store all properties as final attributes.
<.> There is no default constructor for a relationship: Start and end node must be specified. The type is fixed.
<.> Copy constructor for the following two methods
<.> Required to rename this relationship
<.> Required for querying properties

In contrast to the movie, we don't need a static attribute allowing access to the relationship.
This is stored at the owner. In this case, the `Person`:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/model/Person.java[tag=simple-model]
----
<.> We create the relationship properties with `this` concrete instance pointing to another, concrete instance.

=== Summary

While there are possible other ways to define a static meta model with the Cypher-DSL, this is the way we create them with
the `neo4j-cypher-dsl-codegen` models.
