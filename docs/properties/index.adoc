[[properties]]
= Properties

Nodes and Relationships expose properties.
This reflects directly in the Cypher-DSL:

[[properties-on-nodes-and-rel]]
[source,java,indent=0]

include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/PropertiesTests.java[tag=properties-on-nodes-and-rel]
----
<.> Create a property expression from a `Node`
<.> Create a property expression from a `Relationship`

Both Node and Relationship should be named as in the example.
The Cypher-DSL generates names if they are not named, to refer to them in the statements.
Without the explicit names, the generated statement would look like this:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (geIcWNUD000:`Person`)-[TqfqBNcc001:`RATED`]->(:`Movie`) RETURN geIcWNUD000.name, TqfqBNcc001.rating
----

The name is of course random.

The `Cypher` class exposes the `property` method, too. This methods takes in one name (as symbolic name or as string literal) OR one expression
and  at least one further string, referring to the name of the property.

Passing in a symbolic name would lead to a similar result like in <<properties-on-nodes-and-rel>>, an expression can refer
to the results of functions etc.:

----
<.> Here an expression, the `datetime()` function is passed in and the `epocheSeconds` property is dereferenced.

Nested properties are of course possible as well, either directly on nodes and relationships or via the static builder:
