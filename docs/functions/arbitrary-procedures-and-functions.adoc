== Calling arbitrary procedures and functions

Neo4j has plethora of built-in procedures and functions.
The Cypher-DSL does cover a lot of them already, and they can be called in a typesafe way on many `Expression`-instances
taking in various expressions such as the results of other calls, literals or parameters.

However, there will probably always be a gap between what the Cypher-DSL includes and what the Neo4j database brings.
More so, there are fantastic libraries out there like https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/[APOC].
APOC has so many procedures and functions in so many categories that it is rather futile to add shims
for all of them consistently.

Probably the most important aspect of all: many Neo4j users bring their knowledge to the database themselves,
in the form of their stored procedures. Those should be callable as well.

The Cypher-DSL is flexible enough to call all those procedures and functions.

=== Calling custom procedures

Procedures are called via the Cypher https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/call/[CALL-Clause].
The CALL-Clause can appear as a https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/M15/railroad/StandaloneCall.html[StandAlone call]
and as an https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/M15/railroad/InQueryCall.html[InQuery call].
Both are supported by the Cypher-DSL.

==== Standalone procedure calls

Standalone calls are particular useful for `VOID` procedures.
A VOID procedure is a procedure that does not declare any result fields and returns no result records and that has explicitly been declared as `VOID`.
Let's take the first example https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/call/#call-call-a-procedure-using-call[from here]

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=standalone-call]
----
<.> `Cypher.call` returns a buildable statement that can be rendered.
    `Cypher.call` can be used with separate namespace and procedure name as shown here or
<.> with a single argument equal to the name of the procedure.

Of course, arguments can be specified as expressions.
Expressions can be literals as in <<standalone-call-with-args>>, Cypher parameters (via `Cypher.parameter`) that bind your input or nested calls:

[[standalone-call-with-args]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=standalone-call-with-args]
----

Last but not least, the Cypher-DSL can of course `YIELD` the results from a standalone call:

[[standalone-call-yielding]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=standalone-call-yielding]
----
<.> Yielded items can be specified via string…
<.> …or with symbolic names created earlier

A standalone call can spot a `WHERE` clause as well:

[[standalone-call-where]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=standalone-call-where]
----

==== In-query procedure calls

In-query calls are only possible with non-void procedures. An In-query call happens inside the flow of a normal query.
The mechanics to construct those calls via the Cypher-DSL are identical to standalone calls:

[[in-query-calls]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=in-query-calls]
----

A `CALL` can be used after a `MATCH`, a `WITH` and also a `WHERE` clause.

=== Use stored-procedure-calls as expressions (Calling custom functions)

All the mechanics described and shown above - how to define a custom call statement, supply it with arguments etc. - doesn't
distinguish between procedures and functions.
Every stored procedure can be treated as a function - as long as the stored procedure returns a single value.
It doesn't matter if the single value returns a scalar or a list of objects.
A list of objects is still a single value, in contrast to a stream of objects returned by a non-void procedure.

So the question is not how to call a stored custom function, but how to turn a call statement into an expression that can be used in any place in a query where an expression is valid.
This is where `asFunction` comes in.

[[as-function]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=as-function]
----
<.> First we define a call as seen earlier and turn it into an expression
<.> This expression is than used as any other expression

Of course, arguments to those functions can be expressed as well, either as literals or expressions.

[[as-function-with-args]]
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-core/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/core/ArbitraryProceduresAndFunctionsTests.java[tag=as-function-with-args]
----
<.> Same as before
<.> A call to APOC's `camelCase` function, taking in the literal of `first name`.
<.> A call to another APOC function to which a parameter is passed. You find that corresponding placeholder as `$nameParam` in the following assert

=== Summary

Through `Cypher.call` any procedure or function can be called in case one of your favorite procedures is missing in `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Functions`.
All clauses, including `YIELD` and `WHERE` on procedures are supported.
All procedures can be turned into functions.
The Cypher-DSL however does not check if the procedure that is used as a function is actually eligible to do so.

If the Cypher-DSL misses an important builtin Neo4j function, please raise a https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl/issues/new[ticket].
