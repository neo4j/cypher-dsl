== Introduction

The `cypher-dsl-parser` module ins an optional add-on to the Cypher-DSL that takes your existing Cypher - either whole statements
or fragments like clauses or expressions - and turn them into Cypher-DSL statements or expressions.
Those fragments can be used to add custom Cypher to your generated statements without resorting to raw String literals.
It allows sanitizing user input, add additional filters for labels and types to rewrite queries and more.

The parser itself is based on Neo4j's official Cypher-Parser, thus supporting the same constructs as Neo4j itself.
However, while we could theoretically parse all expressions that Neo4j {neo4j-version} supports, we might cannot translate all of them
into elements of the Cypher-DSL. In such cases an `UnsupportedOperationException` will be thrown.

== Getting started

=== Add additional dependencies

==== Maven

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Cypher-DSL parser added via Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser</artifactId>
    <version>{the-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Gradle

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Gradle variant for additional dependencies
----
dependencies {
    implementation '{groupId}:neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser:{the-version}'
}
----

=== Minimum JDK version

The Cypher-Parser requires JDK 11 to run which is the same version that Neo4j {neo4j-version} requires.

=== Main entry point

The main entry point to parsing Cypher strings into Cypher-DSL objects is

[[main-entry-pint]]
.Cypher Parser
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
import org.neo4j.cypherdsl.parser.CypherParser;
----

It provides a list of static methods:

[cols=2*,options=header]
|===
|Method
|What it does

|`parseNode`
|Parses a pattern like `(n:Node {withOrWithout: 'properties'})` into a `Node`

|`parseRelationship`
|Parses a pattern like `(m)-[{a: 'b', c: 'd'}]->(n)` into a `RelationshipPattern`.
 The pattern might be a `Relationship` or `RelationshipChain`.

|`parseExpression`
|Parses an arbitrary expression.

|`parseClause`
|Parses a full clause like `MATCH (m:Movie)` or `DELETE n` etc. These clauses might be modified via
 callbacks and then passed on into `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Statement.of`. This will take them
 in order and create a whole statement out of it. It is your responsibility to make sure those clauses are
 meaningful in the given order.

|`parseStatement`
|Parses a whole statement. The result can be rendered or used in a union or subquery call.

|`parse`
|An alias for `parseStatement`.

|===

The `README` for the parser module itself contains not only our whole TCK for the parser,
but also several examples of calling it. Have a look here: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl/blob/main/neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser/README.adoc[neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser/README.adoc].

All the methods mention above provide an overload taking in an additional `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.parser.Option` instance
allowing to interact with the parser. Please have a look at the JavaAPI for information about the options class.
The following examples show some ways of using it.
Most of the configurable options represent ways to provide filters for labels or types or are callbacks when certain expressions are created.

== Examples

=== Parsing user input and call in a subquery

This is helpful when you create an outer query that maybe enriched by a user.
Here we assume the user does the right thing and don't modify the query any further:

[[example-using-input]]
.Just using the user supplied input
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/parser/CypherDSLParserExamplesTests.java[tag=example-using-input]
----
<.> A valid standalone query that is also a valid subquery
<.> Just parse it into a `Statement` object
<.> Use the Cypher-DSL as explained throughout the docs
<.> Use the overload of `call` that takes a `Statement` and a collection of expression that should be imported into the subquery
<.> Notice how to `WITH` clauses are generated: The first one is the importing one, the second one the aliasing one
<.> This is the original query

=== Ensure an alias for the return clause

We are going to work with the same test as in <<example-using-input>>, so this is not repeated.
Here we  make sure the query supplied by the user returns something with a required alias.

[[example-required-alias]]
.Using a callback to make sure that a query has an alias
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/parser/CypherDSLParserExamplesTests.java[tag=example-required-alias]
----
<.> This is a `Function` that receives an expressions and returns a new one. It
    checks if the provided expressions obeys to some criteria: Here being something that is aliased or not
<.> We start building new options
<.> The callback from step one is passed as callback to the event `ON_RETURN_ITEM` and will be called for every item
<.> The final option instance will be applied to the parser. The statement will render to the same result as <<example-using-input,the first example>>.

=== Preventing certain things

Callbacks can of course be used to prevent things.
Any exception thrown will halt the parsing.
<<example-preventing-things>> shows how:

[[example-preventing-things]]
.Preventing input that deletes properties
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/parser/CypherDSLParserExamplesTests.java[tag=example-preventing-things]
----
<.> Create a callback that just throws an unchecked exception
<.> Configure it for the event that should be prevented
<.> Parsing will not be possible

=== Shape the return clause the way you want

The parser provides `ReturnDefinition` as value object. It contains information to be passed to the `Clauses` factory to shape
a `RETURN` clause the way you need:

[[example-example-shape-the-return-clause]]
.Shaping the return clause
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/parser/CypherDSLParserExamplesTests.java[tag=example-shape-the-return-clause]
----
<.> Create a factory method that takes in a definition and uses its information to build the `RETURN`.
    Or examples filters the attributes being returned and enforces an alias.
    It also adds some arbitrary sorting and keeps sort and limit values from the original
<.> It than is parsed to the options
<.> The statement has the new `RETURN` clause.

=== Enforcing labels

The parser can enforce labels to be present or absent with filters. This can be individually achieved when parsing node patterns,
setting or removing labels with a `BiFunction` like the following:

[[a-label-enforcing-functions]]
.Shaping the return clause
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/parser/RewriteTests.java[tag=enforcing-labels-function]
----
<.> Decide on the event type what is supposed to happen

Putting this function in action involves the `Options` class again:

[[enforcing-on-parse]]
.Enforcing a label is always set on the pattern
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/parser/RewriteTests.java[tag=enforcing-on-parse]
----

This can safely be used to match only nodes spotting such a label for example.

[[enforcing-on-set]]
.Enforcing that a new collection of labels always contains a specific
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/parser/RewriteTests.java[tag=enforcing-on-set]
----

Of course, we can prevent a label to be removed:

[[enforcing-on-remove]]
.Preventing a specific label to be removed
[source, java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-parser/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/parser/RewriteTests.java[tag=enforcing-on-remove]
----

Changing relationship types via a filter is possible as well, but as relationships might only have one type, the number of
usecases is smaller.


=== Combining the parser with SDN's `CypherdslConditionExecutor`

Spring Data Neo4j 6 provides `CypherdslConditionExecutor`. This is a fragment that adds the capability to execute
statements with added conditions to a `Neo4jRepository`.

Given the following repository:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-sdn6/src/main/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/sdn6/movies/PeopleRepository.java[tag=additional-fragments]
----
<.> Allows to just add conditions to our generated queries
<.> Provides an alternative to using @Query with strings

One possible use case is presented in this service:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-sdn6/src/main/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/sdn6/movies/PeopleService.java[tag=using-parser-with-spring]
----
<.> The condition that only people born later than 1980 is hard coded in the service.
    An arbitrary String is than parsed into a condition and attached via `AND`.
    Thus, only valid cypher can go in there and with filters and callbacks, preconditions of that Cypher can be asserted.

The downside to the above solution is that the query fragment passed to the service and eventually the repository must
know the root node (which is `n` in case of SDN 6) and the caller code might look like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-sdn6/src/test/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/sdn6/ApplicationIT.java[tag=exchange1]
----

Notice `n.name` etc.
We could change the service method slightly and apply a callback like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
include::../../neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples/neo4j-cypher-dsl-examples-sdn6/src/main/java/org/neo4j/cypherdsl/examples/sdn6/movies/PeopleService.java[tag=using-parser-with-spring2]
----
<.> Create a function that takes the value of a variable created in the fragment and use it to look up a property on the
    SDN root node.
<.> Create an instance of parsing options. It's probably a good idea todo this once and store them away in an instance variable.
    Options are thread safe.
<.> Apply them when calling the corresponding parse method

Now it's enough to pass `"name contains \"Ricci\" OR name ends with 'Hirsch'"` into the exchange presented above and things
will work out of the box.
Further validation and sanitiy checks are of course up to you.
