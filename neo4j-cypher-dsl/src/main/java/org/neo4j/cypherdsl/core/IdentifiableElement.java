/**
 * This interface represents an element that can be for example an identifiable part of the {@code WITH} clause.
 * It has been introduced to circumvent the absence of union types in Java
 * and to avoid an overload of {@link StatementBuilder#with(String...)} or other expressions with an {@code Object...}
 * parameter. This type here allows passing {@link Named named things}. {@link AliasedExpression aliased expression},
 * {@link SymbolicName symbolic names} into a pipeline.
 * <p>
 * There should be no need to implement this on your own.
