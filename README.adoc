[abstract]
--
The Neo4j Cypher-DSL in its current form is a spin-off from Spring Data Neo4j 6+ (né Spring Data Neo4j⚡️RX), where it is used to generate all Cypher queries.
We thank all contributors to all branches prior to 2020.0 for their effort in creating the previous versions.
--

The primary goal of this project is to have a type safe way of creating Cypher queries targeted at https://neo4j.com[Neo4j 4.0+].
Most of the constructs used here are modelled after https://www.opencypher.org[openCypher], but we include several constructs specific to Neo4j.

The core module of the Neo4j Cypher-DSL has no required runtime dependencies.

== Versioning

This rebooted version of the Neo4j Cypher-DSL uses https://calver.org[CalVer] in the same way Spring does
since early 2020 (see https://spring.io/blog/2020/04/30/updates-to-spring-versions[Updates to Spring Versions]),
starting at _2020.0.0_.

The year digit is treated in a semver fashion for the core module.
That means that you won't experience any breaking changes when staying in a release line.
However, the first or the latest release in a given year does not necessarily reflect the current calendar year.
It's kind of a trade-off, but one that we think is valuable, otherwise we would need to postpone the first release in a year until we need todo some breaking changes.

== Manual

For a gentle introduction and some getting started guides, please use our

== Getting Started

=== Adding the necessary dependencies

First, include the dependency to the Neo4j Cypher-DSL under the following coordinates: `{groupId}:{artifactId}`:

==== Maven configuration

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Inclusion of the Neo4j Cypher-DSL in a Maven project
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>{groupId}</groupId>
	<artifactId>{artifactId}</artifactId>
	<version>{neo4j-cypher-dsl-version-latest}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Gradle configuration

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Inclusion of the Neo4j Cypher-DSL in a Gradle project
----
dependencies {
    compile '{groupId}:{artifactId}:{neo4j-cypher-dsl-version-latest}'
}
----

=== A simple example

With the Cypher-DSL, you can build your queries starting with the static methods provided through `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Cypher`.
Static imports for those packages should be allowed:

[source,java,tabsize=4]
----
import static org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Cypher.*;

import org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core.Cypher;

class SimpleExample {

	public static void main(String... a) {

		var m = node("Movie").named("m");
		var statement = Cypher.match(m)
			.returning(m)
			.build();

		System.out.println(statement.getCypher());
		// Prints MATCH (m:`Movie`) RETURN m
	}
}
----

=== Required Java Version

From version 2023.0.0 onwards, the minimal required Java version to use and build the Cypher-DSL is *Java 17*. If you need a version that is compatible with Java 8, please use 2022.9.x.

== Licensing
