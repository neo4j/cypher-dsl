==== Neo4j-Cypher-DSL Core

The core of the Cypher-DSL is consist of a set of classes that loosely reassemble the https://www.opencypher.org[openCypher spec],
especially in the https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/M15/railroad/Cypher.html[railroad diagrams].

The main package of the core module is `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core` which also reflects in the JDK module name: `org.neo4j.cypherdsl.core`.
Part of the Cypher-DSL core is also the `renderer` package as the main goal of the core is to render Cypher.
The `renderer` package is a sub-package of `core` as it is an essential part of it and in addition, the above mentioned
JDK module name should reflect exactly one package.

So while all other subpackages in `core` can be used freely from the `core` classes themselves, we don't want to access the
`renderer` package apart from one exception: The `AbstractStatement` class can be used to invoke the rendering process without
explicitly specifying a renderer:

[[arch-rules.structure:core-must-not-depend-on-renderer]]
[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
.The Cypher-DSL core package must not depend on the rendering infrastructure

The `renderer` package is not only free to use the whole `core`, it must do so to fulfill its purpose.
The `ast` and `utils` packages however should not have dependencies outside their own:

.Supporting packages must not depend on anything from the outside
