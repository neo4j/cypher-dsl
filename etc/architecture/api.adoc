==== API

===== General considerations

We use https://github.com/apiguardian-team/apiguardian[@API Guardian] to keep track of what we expose as public or internal API.
To keep things both clear and concise, we restrict the usage of those annotations to interfaces, classes (only public methods and constructors:
and annotations.

===== Internal API

While we are pretty clear about the intended use of our classes (being experimental, public API or strictly internal),
we want to make sure that no-one can coincidentally inherit from internal classes that we couldn't restrict to default
package visibility.

There should not be any internal, public API inside the core package.
Everything that needs to be public for reasons (like being used in the renderer), must go into the `internal` package.
This package won't be exported via `module-info.java`.
